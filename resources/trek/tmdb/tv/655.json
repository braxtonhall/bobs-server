Shortly after Picard is diagnosed with a long-term, potentially debilitating brain disorder, he starts experiencing bizarre shifts into three main time periods: 25 years into the future, a few days before the Enterprise-D is sent on its mission to Farpoint station, and the present. Picard realizes that Q is behind these shifts through time.\n\nStardate:  47988.1. After his encounter with Q, Picard assembles the senior staff, and wonders if Q is actually giving him a chance to save humanity by showing him that the spatial anomaly also exists in the past. As they talk, the ship reaches the Neutral Zone, then Picard returns to the future, where Beverly's ship is also on the edge of the Neutral Zone. He convinces a reluctant Worf to accompany the group into Klingon territory, and then travels to the past, where he orders the crew into the Devron system.",

Berman talks about how he regretted not editing his show in an HD-ready format, but was excited when he found out they were remaking the entire show from scratch so they could do it. At first SD upconversion was used, but deemed totally unacceptable for this. If you want to see how something like this comes to pass then you really need to watch this. It's a fascinating look into how much work really went into this. Oh, and here's a little tidbit of information: the 13 seconds of lost footage in \"Sins of the Father\" that was released on the sampler disc, have since been found and will be included in that episode when its season comes out.",

			"overview": "In season two, the Enterprise continues on its journey across the galaxy with the birth of a new member. Picard once again leads the team as unknown civilizations take notice of the ship and wishes to know more about the crew and their operations. Riker struggles with his loyalty to the Enterprise as his life is threatened and Data tries to become more human to understand his role upon the Enterprise. This season looks closer into the relationship of man vs. machine as Q once again tries to test Picard against a new enemy. The Ferengi threatens the Enterprise and the mystery of the holodeck pits the crew against the clock as lives hang in the balance.",

Shortly after Picard is diagnosed with a long-term, potentially debilitating brain disorder, he starts experiencing bizarre shifts into three main time periods: 25 years into the future, a few days before the Enterprise-D is sent on its mission to Farpoint station, and the present. Picard realizes that Q is behind these shifts through time.\n\nStardate:  47988.1. After his encounter with Q, Picard assembles the senior staff, and wonders if Q is actually giving him a chance to save humanity by showing him that the spatial anomaly also exists in the past. As they talk, the ship reaches the Neutral Zone, then Picard returns to the future, where Beverly's ship is also on the edge of the Neutral Zone. He convinces a reluctant Worf to accompany the group into Klingon territory, and then travels to the past, where he orders the crew into the Devron system.",
