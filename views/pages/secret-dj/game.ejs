// TODO
// 1. if the game is not started,
//     you should see a form for your rules
//     even if you have already signed up (it's essentially a put)
//     if you already signed up, there's a link that says "comments" that goes to /games/id/entries/id
//   beneath is a table with everyone else's rules and also links to /games/id/entries/id
//  ALSO if you are the admin of the game, there should be a start button and a delete button
// 2. if the game IS started,
//     you should see your recipient's rules, as well as a form for the playlist
//     there's a link that says "comments" that goes to /games/id/entries/id
//    beneath is a table with everyone else's rules and also links to /games/id/entries/id
//   ALSO, if your playlist is done, it should say it's ready, but we're waiting on max(N, 1) playlists
// 3. if the game is DONE, you should see the playlist you received at the top
//    beneath is a table with everyone else's rules and playlist links!
